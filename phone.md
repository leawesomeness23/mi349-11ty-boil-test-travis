## Why I Can't Leave Without It

My phone is my primary source of communication, navigation, and entertainment. I use it for everything from school to work to watching movies, and it keeps me connected to the world.

I love playing games on it, I have a huge folder of games on it that I play all of the time. On airplanes or long car rides, I love to grind my games out and try to get things that are super rare to get.

## My Favorite Games
- Clash Royale
- Retro Bowl
- Balatro
- Head Soccer
- Road To Die
- Terraria
