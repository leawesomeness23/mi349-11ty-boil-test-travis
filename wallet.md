## Why I Can't Leave Without It

My wallet has everything that is important to me and my finances in it, as well as the key to my apartment at all times because i have to scan it every time i go upstairs. One of if not the most important item to me.

It might not be pretty, but it is Italian leather, and it is missing my ID in the front slot, but I am not uploading a picture of my ID onto Github.
